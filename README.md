exam task from kuraztech

I just build this web page for my exam. It is a task manager website that can allow users to write their todolist regardless of limit and gives the oportunity to tick when they complete their task and after that if they want to delete it it they can delete it by clicking one button.

I use html to structure the webpage and css for dicorate it but unfortunetlly I don't use that much css, and also I use vanella javascript for every interactivity such as get the data(tasks that users add to their todolist) and do such things like display their task orderlly and others.
